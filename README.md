Tektalk is an application in which the user is given
an opportunity to learn a new language in a more fun
and interactive way by letting the learner learn from
their own environment, teaching them the correct pronunciation
of a language and a fun gameplay with a community. The idea
was realized by mainly using the two emerging technologies
Augmented Reality (AR) and Artifical Intelligence (AI)
